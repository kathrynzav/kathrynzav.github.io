            <p>
                Hi! I’m Kat, a recent graduate of NC State University with a B.S. in Computer Science, specializing in Cybersecurity. 
                I’m seeking entry-level opportunities in software engineering or cybersecurity and am also open to roles in technical support or management.<br><br>
                With three technical internships and years of leadership and presentation experience, I have a strong foundation of skills to launch my career.
                You can explore my <a href="files/Resume.pdf" download>resume</a> for detailed information about my professional experience, and the “Stuff” sections below highlight smaller projects I’ve worked on.<br><br>
                In my free time, I enjoy dancing, speedcubing, and playing Dungeons & Dragons. Keep scrolling to learn more!

          <div class="about-text">
            <p>As part of my degree, I completed two senior design projects, one focused on cybersecurity and the other on software engineering.</p>
            <p><b>Software Engineering:</b> I collaborated with <a href="https://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu/index.html">Game2Learn</a> at NC State to create a teacher dashboard for Snap!, a block-based programming language. 
                The dashboard provides real-time updates on student progress and flags when students might need assistance. 
                View my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NwxacZtDKC4?feature=shared&t=2989">presentation</a> to learn more about the platform and how our solution addressed teacher needs.</p>
            <p><b>Cybersecurity:</b> I contributed to a proof-of-concept for a threat modeling AI bot for <a href="https://www.pendo.io/">Pendo</a>. 
                My primary role involved identifying and preparing training materials for the bot, which taught me valuable skills in material formatting, tokenization, 
                prompt engineering, and tolerance testing.</p>
            <p>I also built this website! I'm always open to feedback and new ideas to keep the site fresh.</p>

                <p><b>Dancing</b><br>One of my passions is K-POP cover dancing. Previously, as a co-captain of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KPACKatNCState">KPACK</a>, NC State’s K-POP dance cover group, 
                I spent two years organizing performances and participating in multicultural showcases. I now dance with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JSBDanceCrew/featured">JSB Dance Crew</a>, a Raleigh-based group. 
                Through these experiences, I honed skills in communication, conflict resolution, and collaboration, and I gained a deeper appreciation for the value of diversity in teams.</p>
                <p><b>Speedcubing</b><br>I’m also a speedcuber and have been solving puzzles competitively since 2019. 
                I volunteer at local competitions, assisting with scrambling, judging, and data entry. 
                If I stay in North Carolina for my next role, I plan to pursue becoming a delegate for the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">World Cube Association</a>. 
                Check out my <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2019ZAVA02">cubing profile</a>.</p>
                <p><b>Dungeons & Dragons</b><br>I’m an avid Dungeons & Dragons player and Dungeon Master, running custom campaigns for friends and introducing new players to the game. 
                This hobby allows me to combine creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration in unique and exciting ways. 
                While it’s a purely recreational passion, the teamwork and storytelling involved in D&D are invaluable in both personal and professional contexts.</p>
